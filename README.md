# Professional Portfolio Tyler Rudman

## Description

This project is my professional portfolio. My motivation for this website is to provide a place for me to show off my work to potential employers. This allows me to provide employers with a landing spot for them to review the projects that I have created and find out more about me. This also gives them links to my social media accounts and GitHub. As I progress through bootcamp I will be able to add to this and update accordingly.

Completing this project really helped me to understand the basics of building a website using HTML and CSS from the ground up. I was able to take what I have learned in class and outside through my own studies and create a portfolio that I would be proud to show to future employers.

## Installation

NA

## Usage

To use this portfolio, you can refer to the top navbar where you will be linked to my LinkedIn, GitHub, About Me section and Resume. As you scroll you will also see the project section where I will compile future projects as they are completed to show future employers. At the bottom of the page my contact information is listed.
